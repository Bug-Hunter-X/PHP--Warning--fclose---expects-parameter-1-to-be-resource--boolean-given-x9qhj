```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file); // Close the file handle
}
```
This code has a potential issue: if `fopen()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist),  `$file` will be `false`. The code then attempts to use `fclose()` on `false`, resulting in a warning (or potentially an error depending on the PHP version and error reporting settings).

The `fclose()` function expects a valid file handle. Calling it with `false` is undefined behavior which leads to the error.  While it may seem harmless on some occasions, it's a good practice to check if a file handle is valid before attempting to close it.
